# LC-3 Virtual Machine

A simple virtual machine made for the LC-3 instruction set.

This project was created following an [online tutorial](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/) and [ISA pdf](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/supplies/lc3-isa.pdf) and works on Linux and Windows machines (should also work on Mac OS but has not been tested). The code is mostly the same as what can be found in the tutorial apart from some additional comments, a few added parts for functionality on Windows, and a bit more organization. The test folder contains two files to run the VM on.

## Compiling 
A simple makefile has been provided. For a normal compilation, simply type: 
```
make lc3
```
